# Project--Wine_Quality_Analysis_LSTM

Long short term memory (LSTM) is a model that increases the memory of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks hold short term memory in that they allow earlier determining information to be employed in the current neural networks. 

For completing this project, I used LSTM model for the prediction of stock price.
