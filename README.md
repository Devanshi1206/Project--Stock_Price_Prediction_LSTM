# Project--Stock_Price_Prediction_LSTM

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a model that increases the memory of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks hold short-term memory in that they allow earlier determining information to be employed in the current neural networks. 

To complete this project, I used the LSTM model for the prediction of stock prices.
