To complete this project, I used the LSTM(Long Short Tome Memory) model for the prediction of stock prices.

Skills:

    Python3
    Numpy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Machine Learning Algorithm
    Long Short Time Memory (LSTM)
    
This Notebook shows:

    Data Handling
    Importing Data with Pandas
    Cleaning Data
    Data Visualisation

## Data Analysis:

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a model that increases the memory of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks hold short-term memory in that they allow earlier determining information to be employed in the current neural networks. 

P.S.: If you find this helpful, kindly consider giving it a star rating. Thank you!
